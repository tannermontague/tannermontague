#### About me

##### Born and raised in Seattle, Tanner Montague devotes his waking moments to music. At the end of the day, he dreams drum notations. A dedicated drummer, studying at McNally Smith College of Music in St. Paul, Minnesota, Tanner’s been a sought-after musician since 2008. He opened for Macklemore and Ryan Lewis in 2012 while still living in the Northwest and is the go-to drummer-of-choice whenever he visits home.


##### One word defines Tanner’s work ethic: Driven. One word defines his style: Versatile.  And two words, Tanner’s sum total: Great fun.


##### He draws inspiration from industry veterans: Steve Jordan, Stanton Moore, Benny Greb, Peter Erskine, Steve Gadd and Jeff Hamilton. Tanner’s friends and supporters include singer/ songwriter Ian Moore, Concord recording artist Mindi Abair and Tower of Power’s Roger Smith. He’s a born collaborator. He’s a natural talent. He’ll help you sound great.
